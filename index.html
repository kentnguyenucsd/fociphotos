    <h1>About This Page</h1>
    <p>Foci photography is a business comprised of two people. It focuses on subjects such as fashion, models, landscape, and more. The two people that run this business is Benji Le and Kent Nguyen. They both met through a youth group and slowly got closer as time passed. Benji developed a liking in photography when he had his first camera passed down by his brother. From there, Benji started to experiment and his first model was actually Kent. That is when Kent started to have a small interest in the business and from there, foci was created. Kent is in charge of the technical and accountant side of foci and Benji is the eyes and production of the business. Fociâ€™s mission statement is to be able to create the dreams and visions of others and make it come true through photography.</p>
